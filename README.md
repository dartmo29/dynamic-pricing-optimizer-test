# Dynamic Pricing Optimizer - Test Suite

This repository contains comprehensive test suites for the [Dynamic Pricing Optimizer](https://github.com/dartmo29/dynamic-pricing-optimizer) application. It provides testing for core models, storage functionality, UI components, and integration between different parts of the application.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following areas:

### Core Models
- **CostModel** - Tests for direct costs, time costs, indirect costs, margin calculations, and price recommendations
- **PricingModel** - Tests for different pricing strategies (cost-plus, competitor-based, value-based, optimal blended)
- **CustomerSegmentModel** - Tests for customer segmentation and price elasticity functionality
- **ScenarioModel** - Tests for saving, loading, and comparing pricing scenarios

### Storage Utilities
- Basic storage operations (save, load, remove)
- Scenario management
- Data export and import
- Error handling for storage operations

### UI Components
- **MarketPositionSelector** - Tests for recently updated navigation functionality
- UI component rendering and interaction
- Navigation flow between components and pages

## 🚀 Running Tests

To run the tests, you can use the included test runner:

```bash
node test-runner.js
```

This will execute all tests and generate an HTML report with the results.

## 📋 Test Report

The test runner generates a comprehensive HTML report that includes:
- Overall test statistics (tests run, passed, failed, duration)
- Individual test suite details
- Console logs for each test suite
- Error details for failed tests

## 🔍 Testing Approach

The tests are designed to verify the functionality of the Dynamic Pricing Optimizer before deployment. The approach focuses on:

1. **Unit Testing** - Testing individual components and models in isolation
2. **Integration Testing** - Testing the interaction between different parts of the application
3. **Local Storage Testing** - Ensuring data persistence works correctly
4. **Error Handling** - Verifying that the application handles edge cases and errors gracefully

## 🛠️ Key Test Files

- `test/models.test.js` - Tests for core business logic models
- `test/storage.test.js` - Tests for local storage functionality
- `test/components.test.js` - Tests for UI components
- `test-runner.js` - Test runner that executes all tests and generates a report

## 📊 Test Results

During testing, we've identified and fixed several issues:

1. ✅ **Core Business Logic** - All core models pass tests with expected calculations
2. ✅ **Local Storage** - Data persistence works correctly for all storage operations
3. ✅ **MarketPositionSelector** - Recently updated navigation functionality works as expected
4. ✅ **Component Integration** - All components integrate properly with the main application flow

## 🧭 Future Testing Extensions

Planned future enhancements to the test suite:

1. **End-to-End Testing** - Adding Puppeteer-based testing for full user workflows
2. **Performance Testing** - Adding benchmarks for performance-critical operations
3. **Mobile Responsiveness Testing** - Verifying UI components on different screen sizes
4. **Accessibility Testing** - Ensuring the application is accessible to all users

## 📝 Test Status

The latest test run on March 27, 2025, shows that all tests are passing. The application is ready for deployment.
